# Micromouse_Flip_Flop_Simulator
In winter 2015, I wrote this cpp program that runs a simulator for flip flop algorithm. Flip flop is a widely used algorithm for micromouse, which is a maze solving robot. This simulator can run flip flop on micromouse and find out the shortest distance to reach the center of a 16*16 maze.
